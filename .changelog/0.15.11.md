## 0.15.11

### Added
- Account enabled checkbox added to the User form (enabled even when syncing from AAD)
- Subscription settings now allow optionally syncing "accountEnabled" from AAD
- Lazy loading for Active Directory users in bulk import panel with "Load Users" button
- Search functionality for Active Directory users with server-side filtering
- Progress indicators for AD user loading operations
- Add New User panel now supports lazy loading of Entra ID users and local filtering in the picker
- Internationalization: added new labels for Entra ID user loading and user sync menu (en-GB, nb, nn)

### Changed
- Default bulk user sync no longer includes "accountEnabled" unless explicitly selected
- **PERFORMANCE**: Active Directory users (19k+) no longer fetched on initial page load, improving load times from ~5 seconds to ~500ms
- User synchronization menu now shows "Synchronise all user's properties" when no users selected, "Synchronise selected user's properties" when users are selected
- Bulk import panel now requires explicit "Load Users from Active Directory" action instead of auto-loading all AD users
- User sync operations now load AD users on-demand with appropriate progress messaging
- Add New User panel no longer performs server-side search; uses client-side filtering after explicit load
- Sync action is disabled while Entra ID users are loading, with contextual progress text shown

### Fixed
- Eliminated performance bottleneck caused by fetching all Active Directory users on every admin/users page load
