## 0.15.11 - 15.09.2025

### Added
- Account enabled checkbox added to the User form (enabled even when syncing from AAD)
- Subscription settings now allow optionally syncing "accountEnabled" from AAD
- Lazy loading for Active Directory users in bulk import panel with "Load Users" button
- Search functionality for Active Directory (Entra ID) users with server-side filtering
- Progress indicators for Entra ID user loading operations
- Add New User panel now supports lazy loading of Entra ID users and local filtering in the picker
- Internationalization: added new labels for Entra ID user loading and user sync menu (en-GB, nb, nn)

### Changed
- Default bulk user sync no longer includes "accountEnabled" unless explicitly selected
- **Performance:** Entra ID users (≈19k) no longer fetched on initial page load, improving Admin > Users load time from ~5s to ~500ms
- User synchronization menu now shows context-aware text (all users vs. selected users)
- Bulk import panel now requires explicit "Load Users from Entra ID" action instead of auto-loading
- User sync operations now load Entra ID users on-demand with progress messaging
- Add New User panel no longer performs server-side search after initial load; uses client-side filtering
- Sync action is disabled while Entra ID users are loading, with contextual progress text

### Fixed
- Eliminated performance bottleneck caused by fetching all Entra ID users on every Admin > Users page load
- Fixed AVA test runner configuration (ESM loader cycle) that caused all tests to fail
- Minor adjustment to Google Calendar service

### Documentation
- Added `CLAUDE.md` with project guidance and development instructions
- Updated Copilot and contributor instructions

### CI / Chores
- Enhanced and refactored automatic chores workflow (creation, PR behavior)
- Disabled automatic chores workflow (temporarily) for stability
- Updated contributors list

### Internal
- Version bump to 0.15.11

### Notes
This release focuses on significant scalability improvements for large Entra ID tenants and lays groundwork for more responsive administrative workflows.
