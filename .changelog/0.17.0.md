## 0.17.0 - 16.12.2025

### Highlights
- Bulk edit capability for projects and customers
- Enhanced error handling and delta link management for Entra ID user synchronization
- Major dependency updates with security vulnerability fixes
- Improved environment configuration management

### Added
- Bulk edit capability for projects and customers ([#1314](https://github.com/Puzzlepart/did/pull/1314))
- New `updateProjects` and `updateCustomers` GraphQL mutations
- Multi-selection support in ProjectList and CustomerList
- Enhanced error handling in user sync mutations with improved feedback
- Delta link expiration handling in MSGraphDeltaService
- Extended query timeout support for Entra ID user sync operations
- Progress indicators for user synchronization operations
- `did.instructions.md` agent instruction file for development workflow

### Changed
- Bulk edit panels pre-populate shared field values and reuse common form controls
- Opening the bulk edit panel immediately snapshots the selected items for a stable editing experience
- Improved error handling and delta link management for Microsoft Graph API integration ([#1321](https://github.com/Puzzlepart/did/pull/1321))
- MSGraphDeltaService now gracefully handles expired delta links with automatic fallback to full sync
- User sync mutations now return structured error information to the client
- Refactored dotenv configuration for streamlined environment management ([#1315](https://github.com/Puzzlepart/did/pull/1315))
- Consolidated `.env.sample` files - removed separate production sample in favor of unified configuration
- Updated `.gitignore` to better manage environment files
- Updated all project dependencies to latest stable versions with security patches
- Migrated from deprecated `@octokit` packages to current versions
- Replaced deprecated `string-strip-html` type definitions
- Enhanced type safety in GitHub service with proper numeric conversions using `parseInt`

### Fixed
- Bulk project updates stringify the `extensions` payload to satisfy the GraphQL schema
- Bulk project and customer mutations always include updated labels and no longer drop selection while editing
- Delta link expiration now properly triggers full sync fallback instead of failing
- User sync operations no longer fail silently on delta link errors
- Security vulnerabilities in dependencies resolved through major update
- Deprecated `@types/string-strip-html` dependency removed
- Type safety issues in GitHub service numeric conversions

### Documentation
- Added `did.instructions.md` for AI coding assistants
- Updated environment variable documentation with simplified `.env.sample`
- Improved documentation for user synchronization error handling

### CI / Chores
- Removed unused `defaultChecked` prop from NavigatePeriodsButtons component
- Cleaned up package-lock.json to remove deprecated Octokit dependencies
- Version bump to 0.17.0

### Internal
- Refactored numeric string conversions in GitHub service for better type safety
- Improved code quality with explicit `parseInt` usage over implicit number coercion

### Notes
This release focuses on bulk editing capabilities, enhanced synchronization reliability, dependency maintenance, and developer experience improvements.
