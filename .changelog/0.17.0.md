## 0.17.0 - 16.12.2025

### Highlights
- Bulk edit capability for projects and customers
- Enhanced error handling and delta link management for Entra ID user synchronization
- Major dependency updates with security vulnerability fixes
- Improved environment configuration management
- Better Developer experience; removed localtunnel dependency in favor of Cloudflare Tunnel reverse proxy support

### Added
- Bulk edit capability for projects and customers ([#1314](https://github.com/Puzzlepart/did/pull/1314))
- New `updateProjects` and `updateCustomers` GraphQL mutations
- Multi-selection support in ProjectList and CustomerList
- Enhanced error handling in user sync mutations with improved feedback
- Delta link expiration handling in MSGraphDeltaService
- Extended query timeout support for Entra ID user sync operations
- Progress indicators for user synchronization operations
- `did.instructions.md` agent instruction file for development workflow
- Reverse proxy and Cloudflare Tunnel support for dynamic OAuth callback URLs
- New `getCallbackUrl` utility function for constructing OAuth URLs based on incoming request
- Debug logging for proxy requests in development mode
- Comprehensive documentation for reverse proxy setup in `REVERSE_PROXY_SUPPORT.md`

### Changed
- Bulk edit panels pre-populate shared field values and reuse common form controls
- Opening the bulk edit panel immediately snapshots the selected items for a stable editing experience
- Improved error handling and delta link management for Microsoft Graph API integration ([#1321](https://github.com/Puzzlepart/did/pull/1321))
- MSGraphDeltaService now gracefully handles expired delta links with automatic fallback to full sync
- User sync mutations now return structured error information to the client
- Refactored dotenv configuration for streamlined environment management ([#1315](https://github.com/Puzzlepart/did/pull/1315))
- Consolidated `.env.sample` files - removed separate production sample in favor of unified configuration
- Updated `.gitignore` to better manage environment files
- Updated all project dependencies to latest stable versions with security patches
- Migrated from deprecated `@octokit` packages to current versions
- Replaced deprecated `string-strip-html` type definitions
- Enhanced type safety in GitHub service with proper numeric conversions using `parseInt`
- Express app now trusts proxy headers (`X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-Host`) for proper URL construction behind reverse proxies
- OAuth redirect URIs (`MICROSOFT_REDIRECT_URI`, `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`) are now optional - app dynamically constructs callbacks based on incoming request
- Azure AD and Google OAuth strategies now support dynamic callback URL construction per request
- Webpack configuration handles missing `MICROSOFT_REDIRECT_URI` gracefully with localhost fallback
- Docker Compose override configuration updated to handle optional redirect URI environment variables
- Session storage enhanced to preserve original request protocol and host for OAuth flows

### Fixed
- Bulk project updates stringify the `extensions` payload to satisfy the GraphQL schema
- Bulk project and customer mutations always include updated labels and no longer drop selection while editing
- Delta link expiration now properly triggers full sync fallback instead of failing
- User sync operations no longer fail silently on delta link errors
- Security vulnerabilities in dependencies resolved through major update
- Deprecated `@types/string-strip-html` dependency removed
- Type safety issues in GitHub service numeric conversions

### Documentation
- Added `did.instructions.md` for AI coding assistants
- Improved documentation for user synchronization error handling
- Updated environment variable documentation with simplified `.env.sample`

### CI / Chores
- Removed unused `defaultChecked` prop from NavigatePeriodsButtons component
- Cleaned up package-lock.json to remove deprecated Octokit dependencies
- Version bump to 0.17.0

### Internal
- Refactored numeric string conversions in GitHub service for better type safety
- Improved code quality with explicit `parseInt` usage over implicit number coercion

### Notes
This release focuses on bulk editing capabilities, enhanced synchronization reliability, dependency maintenance, and developer experience improvements. The addition of reverse proxy support enables seamless deployment behind Cloudflare Tunnels and other reverse proxies, with OAuth callbacks automatically adapting to the incoming domain without requiring multiple environment configurations.
