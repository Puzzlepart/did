## 0.16.0 - 24.09.2025

### Highlights
- Deterministic Docker startup (Redis healthcheck + sequencing) eliminates race conditions
- Reproducible Docker builds with lockfile-only install, retry/backoff, and embedded git revision & branch
- Seed data insight & safety: size logging, `--status` non-destructive mode, placeholder secret detection
- Dynamic multi-arch capable build (env-driven platform selection) & normalized image naming
- Security & hygiene: tighter `.dockerignore`, secret warnings, reduced context footprint
- Expanded developer guidance: new `AGENTS.md`, consolidated Docker docs, accessibility & i18n/testing standards
- Auth routing refined so static assets & API routes are public while protected routes remain gated

### Added
- Redis healthcheck and deterministic service startup in Docker Compose
- File size logging for MongoDB seed data import
- Placeholder secret detection, seed summary, and `--status` flag in `docker-quickstart.sh`
- Common reset recipes and security notes in DOCKER.md
- Git build metadata embedding (revision & branch) in Docker/Webpack build
- Dynamic Docker build platform selection (env-driven)
- Normalized Docker image naming for consistent tagging
- Central `AGENTS.md` developer reference (architecture & workflows)
- Accessibility requirements and expanded i18n/component/testing standards documentation

### Changed
- Enforced lockfile integrity in Dockerfile (removed fallback to `npm install`)
- Updated `.dockerignore` to exclude secrets and seed data
- DOCKER.md condensed and clarified for onboarding and troubleshooting
- Resilient npm install with retry/backoff & caching improvements in Dockerfile
- Authentication routing updated to treat static assets & API routes as public
- Consistent lowercase project naming (`did`)
- Adopted modern `docker compose` command syntax
- Increased Docker build test timeout to 300s
- Redis cache port configurability added
- Standardized MongoDB database name to `main` across code and docs

### Fixed
- Removed unused code, comments, and documentation from Docker scripts and configs
- Startup race conditions mitigated via healthcheck sequencing
- Prevented omission of Webpack assets from Docker build context

### Documentation
- Expanded Docker quickstart, troubleshooting, and security guidance
- Added central architecture & workflow reference (AGENTS.md)
- Clarified seed import/reset process & non-destructive status mode
- Added accessibility & development standards (i18n, data management, component structure, testing)

### CI / Chores
- General QA and refactor of Docker-related files

### Internal
- Version bump to 0.16.0

### Notes
This release focuses on dockerization, developer experience, and security hygiene for local development.
