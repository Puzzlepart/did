## 0.16.1 - XX.XX.2025

### Highlights
  - Introduced dedicated permission for locking/unlocking weeks to improve access control clarity. (PR [#1292](https://github.com/Puzzlepart/did/pull/1292))

### Added
  - New `LOCK_UNLOCK_WEEKS` permission (`a7b8c9d0`) protecting the `lockPeriod` mutation.

### Changed
  - Role permissions for authenticated users are now resolved dynamically per request (no logout required after role updates).
  - Webpack Git metadata integration now auto-disables when `git` or `.git` are unavailable (falling back to environment variables or `unknown`), preventing dev container build failures.
  - Express fallback error response changed from 401 to 404 to reduce noisy Unauthorized logs for missing/static assets.

### Fixed
  - Development watch task crash due to incorrect `concurrently` promise handling (removed `.result` usage; added robust promise resolution).
  - Silent failure to start webpack watcher inside Docker because `.tasks` directory was ignored; adjusted `.dockerignore` to include only `watch.js`.
  - Potential build crash when `git` binary absent (now gracefully skipped).

### Documentation
  - (Pending) Recommend adding README notes for `SKIP_GIT_PLUGIN=1` and Docker watch workflow.

### CI / Chores
  - Added helper npm scripts `docker:watch` and `docker:rebuild:watch` for a canonical rebuild/start workflow without wiping MongoDB volumes.
  - Added diagnostic logging to watch script (explicit process start lines, colored prefixes, failure summaries).
  - Improved resilience of dev build by auto-detecting absence of Git and avoiding unnecessary image bloat.

### Internal
  - Version bump to 0.16.1

### Notes
This is a minor patch release focusing on permission granularity and session freshness. See PR [#1292](https://github.com/Puzzlepart/did/pull/1292) for implementation details.
